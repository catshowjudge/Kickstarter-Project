# Kickstarter-Project
This project uses a Decision Tree to predict the success of Kickstarter campaigns based on requested funding amount, start dates, and campaign topics. 

The final project notebook is available in KickstarterFinal.ipynb, and the final slide deck is available through Capstone1_SlideDeck.pptx. The final project report is labeled as Capstone1.pdf. The raw and cleaned data are available as kickstarter-projects.csv and KickstarterClean.csv, respectively.
